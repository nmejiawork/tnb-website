/**
 * Glossary cron script — multi-mode discovery + generation engine.
 *
 * Modes:
 *   bootstrap    — one-time, ~30-40 starter terms (used at launch)
 *   weekly       — ongoing, ~5-10 new terms surfacing in the last 7-14 days,
 *                  via multi-vector pipeline (source-scan + gap-audit lite)
 *   manual       — read scripts/manual-terms.txt, generate definitions for
 *                  any term not yet in /content/glossary/. Deterministic
 *                  backstop. Layer 5.
 *   gap-audit    — adversarial pass: feed model existing corpus + explicit
 *                  gap categories, ask "what's missing?". Up to ~50 terms.
 *   topic-depth  — per-topic forcing function. Args: <mode> <topic>.
 *                  Generate 15-25 terms specifically scoped to one topic.
 *   source-scan  — web-search-grounded pass against deterministic source
 *                  aggregators (GitHub Trending, HN, Product Hunt, etc.) to
 *                  catch viral / post-cutoff products. The OpenClaw fix.
 *
 * Output: each mode writes one MD file per generated term to
 * /content/glossary/. The GitHub Actions workflow then commits and pushes.
 *
 * Spec: BUILD-SPEC.md (D2.1, D2.2, D2.3, D2.4, D4.3, D4.5, D4.6, plus the
 * May 1 currency-reliability upgrade discussion in chat).

// ---------- shared system prompt fragments ----------

const VOICE_AND_FORMAT_PROMPT = `VOICE — TNB-utility (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- Plain English. Light. Doesn't claim authority.
- "When an AI doesn't just answer once, it keeps going. The model takes an action, sees what happens, decides what to do next, and repeats until the job is done." — that's the target tone.
- NOT encyclopedia voice. NOT "AI guru" voice. Peer-explaining, not lecturing.
- NEVER use em dashes (—). Use commas, colons, semicolons, or sentence breaks instead.
- NEVER use the words "platform" or "movement" to describe TNB or anything else in this domain.
- No "in summary," "to wrap up," "in conclusion."
- No filler like "It's worth noting that..." — just say it.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT):
- Reply with a single JSON array. NO preamble, NO postamble, NO markdown code fences.
- Each array element has this exact schema:
  {
    "slug": "kebab-case-slug",
    "term": "Term as displayed (capitalize naturally, no all-caps unless acronym)",
    "type": one of ${JSON.stringify(TYPES)},
    "topic": one of ${JSON.stringify(TOPICS)},
    "familiarity": one of ${JSON.stringify(FAMILIARITIES)},
    "aliases": ["array", "of", "alternate names / spellings / expansions"],
    "related": ["array", "of", "related-term-slugs"],
    "shortDef": "2-3 line plain-English definition, ~30-50 words. Self-contained.",
    "longDef": ["paragraph 1", "paragraph 2", "paragraph 3 (optional)"]
  }

LONG-FORM RULES:
- 2 to 4 paragraphs, ~150-400 words total.
- WRITE SELF-CONTAINED DEFINITIONS. If you reference a term a hobbyist might not know (e.g. "fork", "VS Code", "API"), add a brief inline parenthetical clarification.
- No bullet lists. No headers. Plain prose.

TAXONOMY GUIDANCE:
- type=Concept: ideas, patterns, practices, protocols (agentic loop, RAG, vibecoding, MCP)
- type=Tool: software, products, platforms, services (Cursor, Claude Code, Vercel, Lovable)
- type=Role: job titles or functional roles (FDE, AI engineer, prompt engineer)
- topic: assign exactly ONE. If a term genuinely straddles, pick the most central topic and use related[] for cross-cluster relationships.
- familiarity: assign by who would benefit from looking this up. The bar is the
  AUDIENCE the term primarily serves, not what builders happen to know.
  * Common: a curious non-technical reader (founder, PM, marketer, journalist,
    operator) would plausibly encounter this in normal AI-moment discourse and
    benefit from a plain-English definition. Major model families, mainstream-
    reaching tools (Cursor, Perplexity, Claude Code, Copilot, Replit, Bolt,
    NotebookLM, Sora), conversational-level concepts (RAG, system prompt,
    hallucination, jailbreak, alignment, agentic coding, agent memory at
    high level, fine-tuning at high level, vibe coding, prompt injection,
    generative AI, LLM, foundation/frontier model, context window,
    multimodal model), broadly-discussed roles (AI engineer, ML engineer,
    prompt engineer, head of AI, AI PM, applied AI engineer), policy/regulatory
    (EU AI Act, AI safety), founder-level business concepts (AI wrapper,
    AI COGS, vertical AI, data moat, AI marketplace).
  * Emerging: working builder vocabulary. Useful for someone actively shipping
    AI products or making technical tooling/architecture decisions. Patterns
    at implementation level (function calling, tool calling pattern, structured
    output, prompt chaining, role prompting, task decomposition, multi-turn
    conversation), agent internals (agent state, agent framework, agent
    handoff, agent observability, agent skills, agentic IDE, agentic workflow),
    builder tools beyond mainstream (Hugging Face, Vercel, Supabase, Figma,
    JetBrains AI, Tabnine, Amazon Q Developer, Google AI Studio, Lovable, v0,
    Veo, Devin), model internals at mid-level (base model, instruct model,
    model card, model weights, temperature, token, transformer concept at
    high level, inference at high level), niche roles (AI safety engineer,
    AI red teamer, AI ethicist).
  * Specialist: engineer/researcher deep cut. Under-the-hood mechanics, infra
    primitives, niche tools, research jargon. KV cache, attention mechanism,
    mechanistic interpretability, DPO, SFT, RLHF, vLLM, continuous batching,
    speculative decoding, LoRA, quantization, mixture of experts, world model,
    scaling laws, post-training, agent checkpoint, agent scaffold, model
    distillation, A2A protocol, Constitutional AI, e2b, git worktree, LPU,
    TTFT, OpenTelemetry for AI, serverless inference, ReAct prompting,
    tree of thought, OpenAI-compatible API, CoreWeave, smolagents, Windsurf
    Cascade specifics. Implementation-level model internals (transformer
    architecture, RLHF as a training method).
  Default tendency when uncertain: lean Emerging. Don't put model internals
  (token, temperature, weights, inference) in Common. Don't put research
  jargon (RLHF, transformer, scaling laws) in Common.

ALIASES: Include alternate spellings, full-form expansions of acronyms, common variant phrasings. DO NOT include the term itself.

RELATED TERMS: 2-5 slugs. Use slugs of OTHER terms in this batch OR slugs from the existing-glossary list provided in the user message. DO NOT invent slugs that don't correspond to actual terms.

SLUG FORMAT: All lowercase. Hyphen-separated. ASCII only. No leading/trailing hyphens.`;

AUDIENCE: warm readers — already TNB-aware, clicking through from a newsletter link, a Slack reference, a podcast show note, or another part of the site. They have baseline literacy about AI/startups but need plain-English clarity on emerging vocabulary.

SCOPE: terms a TNB-audience builder would reasonably encounter in conversations on TNB Slack, in LinkedIn posts of Brian and active community members (some technical), or while building with AI. Include both established AI/builder vocabulary and emerging terms surfacing in the wild. EXCLUDE: crypto/web3 terms, generic SaaS jargon, generic startup vocabulary unless AI-relevant.

(f) TRENDING ROLES in AI hiring (last 90 days): job titles surfacing on LinkedIn / Hacker News Who's Hiring / AI startup job pages.
(g) EMERGING CONCEPTS spreading in builder communities: terms you'd hear in TNB Slack, on AI Twitter/X, in podcasts, in newsletters that haven't yet stabilized in mainstream AI vocabulary.

Use the web search tool to ground the definition in current (May 2026) facts. Make 3-4 targeted searches if needed. If after searching you find this term doesn't actually exist or has no meaningful presence in AI builder vocabulary, return an empty JSON array [].

Existing glossary terms (you can reference these in the related[] array):

Output schema: a JSON array containing EXACTLY ONE entry following the standard schema. The slug should be: "${slugify(termName)}" (use this exact slug unless web search reveals the term is canonically known by a different name, in which case use the canonical name).

Return ONLY the JSON array.`;
